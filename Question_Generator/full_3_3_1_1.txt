Surface temperature change is the aspect of climate in which the
climate research community has had most confidence over past IPCC
assessment reports. This confidence comes from the availability of longer
observational records compared to other indicators, a large response to
anthropogenic forcing compared to variability in the global mean, and
a strong theoretical understanding of the key thermodynamics driving
its changes (Collins et al., 2010; Shepherd, 2014). The AR5 assessed 
that it was extremely likely that human activities had caused more than 
half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature from
1951 to 2010, and virtually certain that internal variability alone could
not account for the observed global warming since 1951 (Bindoff et al.,
2013). The AR5 also assessed with very high confidence that climate
models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual
mean surface temperature increase over 1850–2011 and with high
confidence that models reproduce global and Northern Hemisphere
temperature variability on a wide range of time scales (Flato et al.,
2013). This section assesses the performance of the new generation
CMIP6 models (see Table AII.5) in simulating the patterns, trends, and
variability of surface temperature, and the evidence from detection
and attribution studies of human influence on large-scale changes in
surface temperature.
To be fit for detecting and attributing human influence on globallyaveraged surface temperatures, climate models need to represent, based
on physical principles, both the response of surface temperature  to
external forcings and the internal variability in surface temperature
over various time scales. This section assesses the performance of
those aspects in the latest generation CMIP6 climate models. See
Section 3.8 for evaluation at continental scales, Chapter 10 for model
evaluation in the context of regional climate information, and the Atlas
for region-by-region assessments of model performance.
Reconstructions of past temperature from paleoclimate proxies
(Section 2.3.1.1 and Cross-Chapter Box  2.1) have been used to
evaluate modelled past climate temperature change patterns. The
AR5 found that CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012) models were able to
reproduce the large-scale patterns of temperature during the Last
Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Flato et al., 2013) and simulated a polar
amplification broadly consistent with reconstructions for warm
(Pliocene and Eocene) and cold (LGM) periods (Masson-Delmotte
et al., 2013). Since AR5, a better understanding of temperature
proxies and their uncertainties and in some cases the forcing applied
to model simulations has led to better agreement between models
and reconstructions over a wide range of past climates. For the
Pliocene and Eocene warm periods, understanding of uncertainties in
temperature proxies (Hollis et al., 2019; McClymont et al., 2020) and
the boundary conditions used in climate simulations (Haywood et al.,
2016; Lunt et al., 2017) has improved, and some models now agree
better with temperature proxies for these time periods compared
to models assessed in AR5 (Sections 7.4.4.1.2, 7.4.4.2.2 and CrossChapter Box 2.4; Zhu et al., 2019; Haywood et al., 2020; Lunt et al.,
2021). For the Last Interglacial (LIG), improved temporal resolution of
temperature proxies (Capron et al., 2017) and better appreciation of
the importance of freshwater forcing (Stone et al., 2016) have clarified
the reasons behind apparent model-data inconsistencies. Regional
LIG temperature responses simulated by CMIP6 are within the
uncertainty ranges of reconstructed temperature responses, except
in regions where unresolved changes in regional ocean circulation,
meltwater, or vegetation changes may cause model mismatches
(Otto-Bliesner et al., 2021). For the LGM, the CMIP5 and CMIP6
ensembles compare similarly to new sea surface temperature (SST)
and surface air temperature (SAT) proxy reconstructions (Figure 3.2a;
Cleator et al., 2020; Tierney et al., 2020b). The very cold CMIP6
LGM simulation by the Community Earth System Model Version 2.1
(CESM2.1) is an exception related to the high equilibrium climate
sensitivity (ECS) of that model (Section 7.5.6; Kageyama et al., 2021a;
Zhu et al., 2021). Figure 3.2a illustrates the wide range of simulated
global LGM temperature responses in both ensembles. CMIP6 models
tend to underestimate the cooling over land, but agree better with
oceanic reconstructions. For the mid-Holocene, the regional biases
found in CMIP5 simulations are similar to those in pre-industrial and
historical simulations (Harrison et al., 2015; Ackerley et al., 2017),
suggesting common causes. CMIP5 models underestimate Arctic
warming in the mid-Holocene (Yoshimori and Suzuki, 2019). CMIP6
models simulate a mid-latitude, subtropical, and tropical cooling
compared to the pre-industrial period, whereas temperature proxies
indicate a warming (see Section 2.3.1.1.2; Brierley et al., 2020;
Kaufman et al., 2020), although accounting for seasonal effects in the
proxies may reduce the discrepancy (Bova et al., 2021). Over the past
millennium, reconstructed and simulated temperature anomalies,
internal variability, and forced response agree well over Northern
Hemisphere continents, but those statistics disagree strongly in
the Southern Hemisphere, where models seem to overestimate
the response (PAGES 2k-PMIP3 group, 2015). That disagreement is
partly explained by the lower quality of the reconstructions in the
Southern Hemisphere, but model and/or forcing errors may also
contribute (Neukom et al., 2018). Figure  3.2b shows that land/sea
warming contrast behaves coherently in model simulations across
multiple periods, with a slight non-linearity in land warming due to
a smaller contribution of snow cover to temperature response in
warmer climates. A multivariate assessment of paleoclimate model
simulations is carried out in Section 3.8.2.
For the historical period, AR5 assessed with very high confidence
that CMIP5 models reproduced observed large-scale mean surface
temperature patterns, although errors of several degrees appear in
elevated regions, like the Himalayas and Antarctica, near the edge
of the sea ice in the North Atlantic, and in upwelling regions. This
assessment is updated here for the CMIP6 simulations. Figure  3.3
shows the annual mean surface air temperature at 2 m for the
CMIP5 and CMIP6 multi-model means, both compared to the fifth
generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
(ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5; Section 1.5.2) for the
period 1995–2014. The distribution of biases is similar in CMIP5 and
CMIP6 models, as already noted by several studies (Crueger et al.,
2018; Găinuşă-Bogdan et al., 2018; Kuhlbrodt et al., 2018; Lauer
et al., 2018). Arctic temperature biases seem more widespread in
both ensembles than assessed at the time of AR5. The fundamental
causes of temperature biases remain elusive, with errors in clouds
(Lauer et al., 2018), ocean circulation (Kuhlbrodt et al., 2018), winds
(Lauer et al., 2018), and surface energy budget (Hourdin et al., 2015;
Séférian et al., 2016; Găinuşă-Bogdan et al., 2018) being frequently
cited candidates. Increasing horizontal resolution shows promise for
decreasing long-standing biases in surface temperature over large
regions (Bock et al., 2020). Panels e and f of Figure 3.3 show that
biases in the mean High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project
(HighResMIP, Haarsma et al., 2016) models (see also Table AII.6) are
smaller than those in the mean of the corresponding lower-resolution
versions of the same models simulating the same period (see also
Section 3.8.2.2). However, the bias reduction is modest (Palmer and Stevens, 2019). In addition, the biases of the limited number of models
participating in HighResMIP are not entirely representative of overall
CMIP6 biases, especially in the Southern Ocean, as  indicated by
comparing panels b and f of Figure 3.3.
The AR5 assessed with very high confidence that models reproduce
the general history of the increase in global-scale annual mean
surface temperature since the year 1850, although AR5 also reported
that an observed reduction in the rate of warming over the period
1998–2012 was not reproduced by the models (Cross-Chapter
Box 3.1; Flato et al., 2013). Figure 3.2c and Figure 3.4 show time series
of anomalies in annually and globally averaged surface temperature
simulated by CMIP5 and CMIP6 models for the past millennium
and the period 1850 to 2020, respectively, with the baseline set
to 1850–1900 (see Section 1.4.1). As also indicated by Figure 3.4,
the spread in simulated absolute temperatures is large (Palmer and
Stevens, 2019). However, the discussion is based on temperature
anomaly time series instead of absolute temperatures because our
focus is on evaluation of the simulation of climate change in these
models, and also because anomalies are more uniformly distributed
and are more easily deseasonalized to isolate long-term trends (see
Section 1.4.1). CMIP6 models broadly reproduce surface temperature
variations over the past millennium, including the cooling that follows
periods of intense volcanism (medium confidence) (Figure  3.2c).
Simulated GMST anomalies are well within the uncertainty range
of temperature reconstructions (medium confidence) since about
the year 1300, except for some short periods immediately following
large volcanic eruptions, for which simulations driven by different
forcing datasets disagree (Figure 3.2c). Before the year 1300, larger
disagreements between models and temperature reconstructions
are expected because forcing and temperature reconstructions are
increasingly uncertain further back in time, but specific causes have
not been identified conclusively (Ljungqvist et al., 2019; PAGES 2k
Consortium, 2019) (medium confidence). For the historical period,
results for CMIP6 shown in Figure 3.4 suggest that the qualitative
history of surface temperature increase is well reproduced, including
the increase in warming rates beginning in the 1960s and the
temporary cooling that follows large volcanic eruptions.
Although virtually all CMIP6 modelling groups report improvements
in their model’s ability to simulate current climate compared to the
CMIP5 version (Gettelman et al., 2019; Golaz et al., 2019; Mauritsen
et al., 2019; Swart et al., 2019; Voldoire et al., 2019b; T. Wu et al.,
2019b; Bock et al., 2020; Boucher et al., 2020; Dunne et al., 2020), it
does not necessarily follow that the simulation of temperature trends
is also improved (Bock et al., 2020; Fasullo et al., 2020). The CMIP6
multi-model ensemble encompasses observed warming and the
multi-model mean tracks those observations within 0.2°C over most
of the historical period. Figure 3.4 confirms the findings of Papalexiou
et al. (2020), who highlighted based on 29 CMIP6 models that most
models replicate the period of slow warming  between 1942 and
1975 and the late twentieth century warming (1975–2014). The
CMIP6 multi-model mean is cooler over the period 1980–2000 than
both observations and CMIP5 (Figure  3.4; Bock et al., 2020; Flynn
and Mauritsen, 2020; Gillett et al., 2021). Biases of several tenths
of a degree in some CMIP6 models over that period may be due
to an overestimate in aerosol radiative forcing (Sections 6.3.5 and
7.3.3, and Figure 6.8; Andrews et al., 2020; Dittus et al., 2020; Flynn
and Mauritsen, 2020). Papalexiou et al. (2020), Tokarska et al. (2020)
and Stolpe et al. (2021) all report that CMIP6 models on average
overestimate warming from the 1970s or 1980s to the 2010s,
although quantitative conclusions depend on which observational
dataset is compared against (see also Table 2.4). However, Figure 3.4,
which includes a larger number of models than available to those
studies, indicates that the CMIP6 multi-model mean tracks observed
warming better than the CMIP5 multi-model mean after the year
2000. The CMIP6 multi-model mean GSAT warming between 1850–
1900 and 2010–2019 and associated 5–95% range is 1.09 [0.66
to 1.64]  °C. Cross-Chapter Box  2.3 assessed GSAT warming over
the same period at 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21] °C. So some CMIP6 models
simulate a warming that is smaller than the assessed observed range,
and other CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is larger. That
overestimated warming may be an early symptom of overestimated
ECS in some CMIP6 models (Section 7.5.6; Meehl et al., 2020; Schlund
et al., 2020), and has implications for projections of GSAT changes
(Chapter 4; Liang et al., 2020; Nijsse et al., 2020; Tokarska et al., 2020;
Ribes et al., 2021). In some models, a large ECS and a strong aerosol
forcing lead to too large a mid-20th century cooling followed by
overestimated warming rates in the late 20th century when aerosol
emissions decrease (Golaz et al., 2019; Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020).
Temperature biases are driven by both model physics and prescribed
forcing, which is a challenge for model development.
Chylek et al. (2020) argue that CMIP5 models overestimate the
temperature response to volcanic eruptions. Lehner et al. (2016),
Rypdal (2018) and Stolpe et al. (2021) point instead to missed
compensating effects on surface temperature change associated
with internal variability in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
or the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). An alternative view
sees those ENSO and AMO responses as expressions of changes in
climate feedbacks driven by the geographical pattern of SST changes
(Andrews et al., 2018). At least one model is able to reproduce such
pattern effects (Gregory and Andrews, 2016). Errors in the volcanic
forcing prescribed in simulations, including for CMIP6 (Rieger et al.,
2020), also introduce differences with the observed temperature
response, independently of the quality of the model physics. In
addition, comparisons of the modelled temperature  response
to large eruptions over the past millennium to temperature
reconstructions based on tree rings show a much better agreement
(Lücke et al., 2019; F. Zhu et al., 2020) than comparisons to the annual,
multi-temperature proxy reconstructions shown in Figure 3.2c. These
considerations, and Figures 3.2c and 3.4, suggest that CMIP6 models
do not systematically overestimate the cooling that follows large
volcanic eruptions (see also Cross-Chapter Box 4.1).
When interpreting model simulations of historical temperature change,
it is important to keep in mind that some models are tuned towards
representing the observed trend in global mean surface temperature
over the historical period (Hourdin et al., 2017). In Figure  3.4 the
CMIP6 models that are documented to have been tuned to reproduce
observed warming, typically by tuning aerosol forcing or factors
that influence the model’s ECS, are marked with an asterisk. Such
tuning of a model can strongly impact its temperature projections
(Mauritsen and Roeckner, 2020). However, Bock et al. (2020) reported 
that there is no statistically significant difference in multi-model
mean GSAT between the models that had been tuned based on
observed warming compared to those which had not. Moreover,
only two of thirteen models used for the Detection and Attribution
Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) simulations on which CMIP6
attribution studies are based were tuned towards historical warming
(Bock et al., 2020; Gillett et al., 2021). Further, tuning is done on
globally averaged quantities, so does not substantially change the
spatio-temporal pattern of response on which many regressionbased attribution studies are based (Bock et al., 2020). Therefore, we
assess with high confidence that the tuning of a small number of
CMIP6 models to observed warming has not substantially influenced
attribution results assessed in this chapter.
The reliance of detection and attribution studies on climate models
(see  Section 3.2) requires that those models simulate realistic
statistics of internal variability on multi-decadal time scales. An
incorrect estimate of variability in models would affect confidence 
in the conclusions from detection and attribution. The AR5 found
that CMIP5 models simulate realistic variability in global-mean
surface temperature on decadal time scales, with variability on
multi-decadal time scales being more difficult to evaluate because
of the short observational record (Flato et al., 2013). Since AR5, new
work has characterized the contributions of variability in different
ocean areas to SST variability, with tropical modes of variability like
ENSO dominant on time scales of five to ten years, while longer time
scales see the variance maxima move poleward to the North Atlantic,
North Pacific, and Southern oceans (Monselesan et al., 2015). There
may, however, be sizeable, two-way interdependencies between
ENSO and sea surface temperature variability in different basins
(Kumar et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2019), and ENSO’s influence on global
surface temperature variability may not be confined only to decadal
time scales (Triacca et al., 2014). Studies based on large ensembles
of 20th and 21st century climate change simulations confirm that
internal variability has a substantial influence on global warming
trends over periods shorter than 30–40 years (Kay et al., 2015; Dai
and Bloecker, 2019). Although the equatorial Pacific seems to be the
main source of internal variability on decadal time scales, Brown
et al. (2016a) linked diversity in modelled oceanic convection, sea
ice, and energy budget in high-latitude regions to overall diversity in
modelled internal variability.
Interest in internal variability since the publication of AR5 stems in
part from its importance in understanding the slower global surface
temperature warming over the early 21st century (see Cross-Chapter
Box 3.1). Evidence coming mostly from paleo studies is mixed on
whether CMIP5 models underestimate decadal and multi-decadal
variability in global mean temperature. Schurer et al. (2013) found
good agreement between internal variability derived from paleo
reconstructions, estimated as the fraction of variance that is not
explained by forced responses, and modelled variability, although
the subset of CMIP5 models they used may have been associated
with larger variability than the full CMIP5 ensemble. PAGES 2k
Consortium (2019) found that the largest 51-year trends in both
reconstructions of global mean temperature and fully forced climate
simulations over the period 850 to 1850 were almost identical. Zhu
et al. (2019) showed agreement in the modelled and reconstructed
temporal spectrum of global surface temperatures on annual to
multi-millennial time scales. However, they suggest that decadal- to
centennial variability is partly forced by slow orbital changes that
predate the last millennium. This is consistent with Gebbie and
Huybers (2019), who showed that the deep ocean has been out
of equilibrium over that period. Laepple and Huybers (2014) found
good agreement between modelled and proxy-derived decadal
ocean temperature variability, but underestimates of variance by
models by at least a factor of ten at centennial time scales because
models underestimate the difference between the warm and cold
periods of the last millennium. Parsons et al. (2020) found that some
CMIP6 models exhibit much higher multi-decadal variability in GSAT
than CMIP5 models, with indications that variability in these models
s also higher than that from proxy reconstructions. CMIP6 models
may not share the underestimation by CMIP5 models of variability
in decadal to multi-decadal modes of variability, such as Pacific
Decadal Variability (Section 3.7.6; England et al., 2014; Thompson
et al., 2014; Schurer et al., 2015) and Atlantic Multi-decadal
Variability (AMV), which may be partly forced, (see Section 3.7.7)
but this assessment is limited by the small number of available
studies. For the Southern Hemisphere, Hegerl et al. (2018) found an
instance of internal variability in the early 20th century larger than
that modelled, but indicated that could be an observational issue.
Friedman et al. (2020) found biases in interhemispheric SST contrast
in some models that may be consistent with underestimated cooling
after early-20th century eruptions or underestimated Pacific Decadal
Variability, but could also be due to an imperfect separation between
internal variability and forced signal in the observations. Figure 3.2c,
updated from PAGES 2k Consortium (2019), compares modelled
temperatures to reconstructions over the last millennium. It indicates
that models reproduce the observed variability well, at least for the
time scales between 20 and 50 years that paleo reconstructions
typically resolve and that the figure represents. In summary, decadal
GMST variability simulated in CMIP6 models spans the range of
residual decadal variability in large-scale reconstructions (medium
evidence, low agreement).
In addition, new literature suggests that anthropogenic forcing
itself may locally increase or decrease variability in surface
temperatures (Screen et al., 2014; Qian and Zhang, 2015; Brown
et al., 2017; Park et al., 2018; Santer et al., 2018; Weller et al.,
2020). These studies imply limitations in the use of pre-industrial
control simulations to quantify the role of unforced variability over
the historical period. Some recent attribution studies (Gillett et al.,
2021; Ribes et al., 2021) have estimated variability from ensembles
of forced simulations instead, which would be expected to resolve
any such changes in variability.
Figure  3.5 shows the standard deviation of zonal-mean surface
temperature in CMIP6 pre-industrial control simulations and observed
temperature datasets. Results are consistent with those based
on CMIP5 models, which showed the largest model spread where
variability is also large, in the tropics and mid- to high latitudes (Flato
et al., 2013). Modelled variability is within a factor two of observed
variability over most of the globe. The apparent overestimation of
high latitude variability in models compared to observations may
be due to interpolation and infilling over data sparse high latitude
regions in the observational products shown here (Jones, 2016).
The previous paragraph took an ensemble-mean view of model
performance, but individual models disagree on unforced variability.
Figure 3.6 illustrates the large differences in GSAT variability in unforced
CMIP6 pre-industrial control simulations, following the method of
Parsons et al. (2020). Surface temperatures in pre-industrial conditions
are especially variable in the ten models highlighted in Figure 3.6a,
and some models substantially exceed the variability seen in CMIP5
models (Parsons et al., 2020). Figure 3.6b shows that the distribution
of warming trends simulated by CMIP6 models in historical simulations
is clearly distinct from that simulated in unforced pre-industrial control
simulations. Still, the unforced variability of the five most variable
models approaches half that observed over the historical period
under anthropogenically forced conditions (Figure 3.6c; Parsons et al.,
2020; Ribes et al., 2021). For  the Centre National de la Recherche
Météorologique (CNRM) models, which are among the most variable,
the large, low-frequency variability is attributed to strong simulated
Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (Séférian et al., 2019; Voldoire et al.,
2019b), which is difficult to rule out because of the short observational
record (Section 3.7.7; Cassou et al., 2018). But, importantly, patterns
of temperature variability simulated by even the most variable models
differ from the pattern of forced temperature change (Parsons et al.,
2020). Taken together, this discussion and Figures  3.2, 3.5 and 3.6
indicate that the statistics of internal variability in models compare
well in most cases to observational estimates and temperature proxy
reconstructions, though some CMIP6 models appear to have higher
multi-decadal variability than CMIP5 models or proxy reconstructions.
When used in attribution studies, models with overestimated
variability would increase estimated uncertainties and make results
statistically conservative.
In summary, there is high confidence that CMIP6 models reproduce
observed large-scale mean surface temperature patterns and internal
variability as well as their CMIP5 predecessors, but with little evidence
for reduced biases. CMIP6 models also reproduce historical GSAT
changes similarly to their CMIP5 counterparts (medium confidence).
However, in spite of model imperfections, there is very high confidence
that biases in surface temperature trends and variability simulated
by the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles are small enough to support
detection and attribution of human-induced warming. Looking at periods preceding the instrumental record, AR5 assessed
with high confidence that the 20th century annual mean surface
temperature warming reversed a 5000-year cooling trend in Northern
Hemisphere mid- to high latitudes caused by orbital forcing, and
attributed the reversal to anthropogenic forcing with high confidence
(see also Section 2.3.1.1). Since AR5, the combined response to solar,
volcanic and greenhouse gas forcing was detected in all Northern
Hemisphere continents (PAGES 2k-PMIP3 group, 2015) over the
period 864 to 1840. In contrast, the effect of those forcings was not
detectable in the Southern Hemisphere (Neukom et al., 2018). Global
and Northern Hemisphere temperature changes from reconstructions
over this period have been attributed mostly to volcanic forcing
(Schurer et al., 2014; McGregor et al., 2015; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016;
PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019; Büntgen et al., 2020), with a smaller
role for changes in greenhouse gas forcing, and solar forcing playing
a minor role (Schurer et al., 2014; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019).
Focusing now on warming over the historical period, AR5 assessed
that it was extremely likely that human influence was the dominant
cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century, and
that it was virtually certain that warming over the same period
could not be explained by internal variability alone. Since AR5 many
new attribution studies of changes in global surface temperature
have focused on methodological advances (see also Section 3.2).
Those advances include better accounting for observational and
model uncertainties, and internal variability (Ribes and Terray, 2013;
Hannart, 2016; Ribes et al., 2017; Schurer et al., 2018); formulating
the attribution problem in a counterfactual framework (Hannart and
Naveau, 2018); and reducing the dependence of the attribution on
uncertainties in climate sensitivity and forcing (Otto et al., 2015;
Haustein et al., 2017, 2019). Studies now account for uncertainties
in the statistics of internal variability, either explicitly (Hannart, 2016;
Hannart and Naveau, 2018; Ribes et al., 2021) or implicitly (Ribes and
Terray, 2013; Schurer et al., 2018; Gillett et al., 2021), thus addressing
concerns about over-confident attribution conclusions. Accounting for
observational uncertainty increases the range of warming attributable
to greenhouse gases by only 10 to 30% (Jones and Kennedy, 2017;
Schurer et al., 2018). While some attribution studies estimate
attributable changes in globally-complete GSAT (Schurer et al., 2018;
Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021), others attribute changes in
observational GMST, but this makes little difference to attribution
conclusions (Schurer et al., 2018). Moreover, based on a synthesis of
observational and modelling evidence, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 assesses
that the current best estimate of the scaling factor between GMST and
GSAT is one, and therefore attribution studies of GMST and GSAT are 
here treated together in deriving assessed warming ranges. Studies
also increasingly validate their multi-model approaches using imperfect
model tests (Schurer et al., 2018; Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021).
Alternative techniques, based purely on statistical or econometric
approaches, without the need for climate modelling, have also been
applied (Estrada et al., 2013; Stern and Kaufmann, 2014; Dergiades
et al., 2016) and match the results of physically-based methods. The
larger range of attribution techniques and improvements to those
techniques increase confidence in the results compared to AR5.
In contrast, studies published since AR5 indicate that closely
constraining the separate contributions of greenhouse gas changes
and aerosol changes to observed temperature changes remains
challenging. Nonetheless, attribution of warming to greenhouse gas
forcing has been found as early as the end of the 19th century (Schurer
et al., 2014; Owens et al., 2017; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019). Hegerl
et al. (2019) found that volcanism cooled global temperatures by
about 0.1°C between 1870 and 1910, then a lack of volcanic activity
warmed temperatures by about 0.1°C between 1910 and 1950,
with anthropogenic aerosols cooling temperatures throughout the
20th century, especially between 1950 and 1980 when the estimated
range of aerosol cooling was about 0.1°C to 0.5°C. Jones et al. (2016)
attributed a warming of 0.87 to 1.22°C per century over the period
1906 to 2005 to greenhouse gases, partially offset by a cooling of
−0.54°C to −0.22°C per century attributed to aerosols. But they also
found that detection of the greenhouse gas or the aerosol signal
often fails, because of uncertainties in modelled patterns of change
and internal variability. That point is illustrated by Figure 3.7, which
shows two- and three-way fingerprinting regression coefficients for 13
CMIP6 models and the corresponding attributable warming ranges,
derived using HadCRUT4 (Gillett et al., 2021). Regression coefficients
with an uncertainty range that includes zero mean that detection has
failed. Models with regression coefficients significantly less than one
significantly overpredict the temperature response to the corresponding
forcing. Conversely, models with regression coefficients significantly
greater than one underpredict the response to these forcings. While
estimates of warming attributable to anthropogenic influence derived
using individual models are generally consistent, estimates of warming 
attributable to greenhouse gases and aerosols separately based on
individual models are not all consistent, and detection of the aerosol
influence fails more often than that of greenhouse gases. Hence,
results of recent studies emphasize the need to use multi-model
means to better constrain estimates of GSAT changes attributable to
greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing (Schurer et al., 2018; Gillett et al.,
2021; Ribes et al., 2021).
Figure 3.8 compares attributable changes in globally complete GSAT
for the period 2010–2019 relative to 1850–1900 from three detection
and attribution studies, two of which use CMIP6 multi-model means
(Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021), and an estimate based on
assessed effective radiative forcing and transient and equilibrium
climate sensitivity (see Section 7.3.5.3). The reference period
1850–1900 is used to assess attributable temperature changes
because this is when the earliest gridded surface temperature
records start, this is when the CMIP6 historical simulations start,
this is the earliest base period used in attribution literature, and
this is a reference period used in IPCC SR1.5 and earlier reports.
It should, however, be noted that Cross-Chapter Box  1.2 assesses
with medium confidence that there was an anthropogenic warming
with a likely range of 0.0°C–0.2°C between 1750 and 1850–1900.
Figure  3.8 also shows the GSAT changes directly simulated in
response to these forcings in thirteen CMIP6 models. In spite of their
different methodologies and input datasets, the three attribution
approaches yield very similar results, with the anthropogenic
attributable warming range encompassing observed warming, and
the natural attributable warming being close to zero. The warming
driven by greenhouse gas increases is offset in part by cooling due
to other anthropogenic forcing agents, mostly aerosols, although
uncertainties in these contributions are larger than the uncertainty in
the net anthropogenic warming, as discussed above. Estimates based
on physical understanding of forcing and ECS made by Chapter 7 are
close to estimates from attribution studies, despite being the products
of a different approach. This agreement enhances confidence in the
magnitude and causes of attributable surface temperature warming.
The AR5 found high confidence for a major role for anthropogenic
forcing in driving warming over each of the inhabited continents,
except for Africa where they found only medium confidence
because of limited data availability (Bindoff et al., 2013). At the
hemispheric scale, Friedman et al. (2020) and Bonfils et al. (2020)
detected an anthropogenically forced response of inter-hemispheric
contrast in surface temperature change, which has a complex time
evolution but shows the Northern Hemisphere cooling relative
to the Southern Hemisphere until around 1975 but then warming
after that. Bonfils et al. (2020) attribute the Northern Hemisphere
reversal to a combination of reduced aerosol forcing and greenhouse
gas induced warming of Northern Hemisphere land masses.
Friedman et al. (2020) found that CMIP5 models simulate the 
correct sign of the inter-hemispheric contrast when forced with all
forcings but underestimate its magnitude. Figure 3.9 shows global
surface temperature change in CMIP6 all-forcing and natural-only
simulations globally, averaged over continents, and separately over
land and ocean surfaces. All-forcing simulations encompass observed
temperature changes for all regions, while natural-only simulations
fail to do so in recent decades except in Antarctica, based on the
annual means shown. As stated above, warming results from
a partial offset of greenhouse gas warming by aerosol cooling. That
offset is stronger over land than ocean. Regionally, models show
a large range of possible temperature responses to greenhouse gas
and aerosol forcing, which complicates single-forcing attribution.
A more detailed discussion of regional attribution can be found in
Section 10.4. Over global land surfaces, Chan and Wu (2015) used
CMIP5 simulations to attribute a warming trend of 0.3 (2.5%–97.5%
confidence interval: 0.2–0.36) °C per decade to anthropogenic
forcing, with natural forcing only contributing 0.05 (0.02–0.06) °C
per decade. Accounting for unsampled sources of uncertainty and the
availability of only a single study, their result suggests that it is very
likely that human influence is the main driver of warming over land.
In summary, since the publication of AR5, new literature has
emerged that better accounts for methodological and climate model
uncertainties in attribution studies (Ribes et al., 2017; Hannart and
Naveau, 2018) and that concludes that anthropogenic warming
is approximately equal to observed warming over the 1951–2010
period. The IPCC SR1.5 reached the same conclusion for 2017 relative
to 1850–1900 based on anthropogenic warming and associated
uncertainties calculated using the method of Haustein et al. (2017).
Moreover, the improved understanding of the causes of the apparent
slowdown in warming over the beginning of the 21st century and
the difference in simulated and observed warming trends over this
period (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1) further improve our confidence in the
assessment of the dominant anthropogenic contribution to observed
warming. In deriving our assessments, these considerations are
balanced against new literature that raises questions about the ability
of some models to simulate variability in surface temperatures over
a  range of time scales (Laepple and Huybers, 2014; Parsons et al.,
2017; Friedman et al., 2020), and the finding that some CMIP6 models
exhibit substantially higher multi-decadal internal variability than
that seen in CMIP5, which remains to be fully understood (Parsons
et al., 2020; Ribes et al., 2021). Further, uncertainties in simulated
aerosol-cloud interactions are still large (Section 7.3.3.2.2), resulting
in very diverse spatial responses of different climate models to
aerosol forcing, and inter-model differences in the historical global
mean temperature evolution and in diagnosed cooling attributable to
aerosols (Figure 3.8). Moreover, like previous generations of coupled
model simulations, historical and single forcing CMIP6 simulations
follow a common experimental design (Eyring et al., 2016a; Gillett
et al., 2016) and are thus all driven by the same common set of
forcings, even though these forcings are uncertain. Hence, forcing
uncertainty is not directly accounted for in most of the attribution and
model evaluation studies assessed here, although this limitation can
to some extent be addressed by comparing with previous generation
multi-model ensembles or individual model studies using different
sets of forcings.
The IPCC SR1.5 best estimate and likely range of anthropogenic
attributable GMST warming was 1.0 ± 0.2°C in 2017 with respect
to the period 1850–1900. Here, the best estimate is expressed
in terms of GSAT and is calculated as the average of the three
estimates shown in Figure 3.9, yielding a value of 1.07°C. Ranges
for attributable GSAT warming are derived by finding the smallest
ranges with a precision of 0.1°C which span all of the 5–95% ranges
from the attribution studies shown in Figure 3.9. These ranges are
then assessed as likely rather than very likely because the studies
may underestimate the importance of the structural limitations of
climate models, which probably do not represent all possible sources
of internal variability; use too simple climate models, which may
underestimate the role of internal variability; or underestimate model
uncertainty, especially when using model ensembles of limited size
and inter-dependent models, for example through common errors in
forcings across models, as discussed above. This leads to a likely range
for anthropogenic attributable warming in 2010–2019 relative to
1850–1900 of 0.8 to 1.3°C in terms of GSAT. This range encompasses
the best estimate and very likely range of observed GSAT warming of
1.06 [0.88 to 1.21] °C over the same period (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3).
There is medium confidence that the best estimate and likely ranges
of attributable warming expressed in terms of GMST are equal to
those for GSAT (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3). Repeating the process for
other time periods leads to the best estimates and likely ranges listed
in Table 3.1. GSAT change attributable to natural forcings is −0.1 to
+0.1°C. The likely range of GSAT warming attributable to greenhouse
gases is assessed in the same way to be 1.0 to 2.0°C while the GSAT
change attributable to aerosols, ozone and land-use change is −0.8
to 0.0°C. Progress in attribution techniques allows the important
advance of attributing observed surface temperature warming since
1850–1900, instead of since 1951 as was done in AR5. The IPCC AR5 assessed the likely range of the contribution of internal
variability to GMST warming to be −0.1 to +0.1°C over the period
1951–2010. Since then, several studies have downplayed the
contribution of internal modes of variability to global temperature
variability, often by arguing for a forced component to those internal
modes (Mann et al., 2014; Folland et al., 2018; Haustein et al.,
2019; Liguori et al., 2020). Haustein et al. (2017) found a 5–95%
confidence interval of −0.09°C to +0.12°C for the contribution of
internal variability to warming between 1850–1879 and 2017.
Ribes et al. (2021) imply a contribution of internal variability of
−0.02°C ± 0.16°C to warming between 2010–2019 and 1850–1900,
assuming independence between errors in the observations and in
the estimate of the forced response. Based on these studies, but
allowing for unsampled sources of error, we assess the likely range
of the contribution of internal variability to GSAT warming between
2010–2019 and 1850–1900 to be −0.2°C to +0.2°C.
The IPCC SR1.5 gave a likely range for the human-induced warming rate
of 0.1°C to 0.3°C per decade in 2017, with a best estimate of 0.2°C per
decade (Allen et al., 2018). Table 3.1 lists the estimates of attributable
anthropogenic warming rate over the period 2010–2019 based on the
three studies that underpin the assessment of GSAT warming (Haustein
et al., 2017; Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021). Estimates from
Haustein et al. (2017), based on observed warming, and Ribes et al.
(2021), based on CMIP6 simulations constrained by observed warming,
are in good agreement. The Gillett et al. (2021) estimate, also based
on CMIP6 models, corresponds to a larger anthropogenic attributable
warming rate, because of a smaller warming rate attributed to natural
forcing than in Ribes et al. (2021). This disagreement does not support
a decrease in uncertainty compared to the SR1.5 assessment. So the
range for anthropogenic attributable surface temperature warming
rate of 0.1°C to 0.3°C per decade is again assessed to be likely, with a
best estimate of 0.2°C per decade.
