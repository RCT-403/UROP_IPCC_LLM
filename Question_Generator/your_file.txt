The observed decrease of Arctic sea ice area is a  key indicator of
large-scale climate change.
The SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019) assesses that sea ice extent, which
is the total area of all grid cells with at least 15% sea ice concentration,
has declined since 1979 in each month of the year (very high
confidence). In contrast to SROCC, we assess changes in sea ice area
(the actual area of the ocean covered by sea ice) rather than sea ice
extent, because sea ice area is geophysically more relevant and not
grid-dependent (Notz, 2014; Ivanova et al., 2016; Notz et al., 2016;
Notz and SIMIP Community, 2020). Arctic sea ice area is calculated
based on measurements by passive microwave satellite sensors that
provide near-continuous measurements of gridded, pan-Arctic sea
ice concentration from 1979 onwards. Irreducible uncertainties in the
conversion of thermal microwave brightness temperature to sea ice
concentration, and choices in algorithm design, cause uncertainties in
observed Arctic sea ice area, which are far smaller than the observed
sea ice loss (e.g., Comiso et al., 2017a; Niederdrenk and Notz, 2018;
Alekseeva et al., 2019; Kern et al., 2019; Meier and Stewart, 2019).
Sea ice area has decreased in every month of the year from 1979 to
the present (very high confidence) (Figure  9.13). The absolute and
the relative ice losses are highest in late summer-early autumn (high
confidence) (Figure 9.13). Averaged over the decade 2010–2019, the
monthly Arctic sea ice area from August to October has been around
2 million km² (or about 25%) smaller than during 1979–1988 (high
confidence) (Figure 9.13).
The SROCC discussed the regional distribution of Arctic sea ice loss,
and the findings remain valid for the updated time series covering
2019 (Figure 9.13). Sea ice loss in winter is strongest in the Barents
Sea, while summer losses occur primarily at the summer sea ice
region margins, in particular in the East Siberian, Chukchi, Kara and
Beaufort Seas (Frey et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Onarheim et al.,
2018; Peng and Meier, 2018; Maksym, 2019). In the Bering Sea,
expanding winter sea ice cover was observed until 2017 (Frey et al.,
2015; Onarheim et al., 2018; Peng and Meier, 2018), but a marked
reduction in sea ice concentration has occurred since then (high
confidence) (Stabeno and Bell, 2019).
